Guidelines for pull requests
===
### I don't know how to download/install these mods
Please ask for support on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tomdevs). Do **not** create a pull request to ask for help, to spam or to request new features.

### I want to request new features
Again, request them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tomdevs). Do **not** create a pull request to request new features here.

### I want to add new features/fix bugs by editing the source
You are welcome to contribute using the _Pull Request_ button. However, please do not submit obfuscated code (code that is messed up to decrease readability) because it would lead to difficulties on deciding whether your code is relavent.
